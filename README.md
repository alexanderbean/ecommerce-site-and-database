Spring 2023 - Coffee Shop Website w/ E-Commerce &amp; Order Database

This is a continuation of the javajamsite project, which is a directed case study of an HTML-built coffee shop site.

This continuation adds e-commerce functionality with the creation of an order form page. A user may select the product they would like to order, and the order price will adjust. Input validation has been put in place to prevent invalid characters, negative integers, or decimal values in floats. This page is built primarily using tables and JavaScript functions which are properly formatted in the cascading style sheet. 

User and order information is stored in a database that is supported by Java and Derby.
